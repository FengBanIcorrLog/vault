Unidentified File Organizer

My attempt to get a working QT-based file manager by gluing the code I found on github.

It is right now mostly based on QtFileManager and my coding skills, which does not get us far.<br />
But here's what's ready:<br />
$ Delete, Copy, paste
$ Image preview (gif/mng)
$ Plugin support


TODO:<br /><br />
